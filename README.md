This repository is my personal collection for replicating and exploring various methodologies in EEG-based emotion recognition. My goal is to systematically reproduce key findings from published research, compare my results with reported figures, and provide a clear, accessible overview of different approaches in the field.

# ðŸ“ˆ Replication Results
The following table summarizes my replication efforts, comparing my achieved results with those reported in the original papers.
